# Downloads Organizer in Python

This is a simple Python script that organizes the Downloads folder.

It looks at each file in the Downloads folder and moves it into a subfolder based on the file type, such as:

- `Images`
- `Documents`
- `Videos`
- `Audio`
- `Archives`
- `Code`
- `Installers`
- `Other`

## How to use

1. Install Python 3.
2. Save `downloads_organizer.py` to a folder, for example `Desktop/downloads-organizer`.
3. Open Command Prompt.
4. Go to the folder:
   `cd %HOMEPATH%\Desktop\downloads-organizer`
5. Run the script:
   `python downloads_organizer.py`

The script will organize the files in your Downloads folder into category subfolders.
